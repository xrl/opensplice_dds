/* RTPS_USE_MCAST controls whether or not the RTPS protocol
   implementation will ever send a multicast packet (it always accepts
   them); if ..._LOOPBACK is set, IP_MULTICAST_LOOP will be set to
   true (loopback enabled), else to false (loopback disabled).

   If there is only one OpenSplice DDSI service on a host, LOOPBACK
   disabled will do just fine and give better performance. If
   communication with another DDSI implemetation running on the same
   host is desired, better leave it enabled.

   RTPS_IGNORE_OWN_VENDOR causes the message interpreter to ignore all
   messages originating from a node with the own vendor id, allowing
   DDSI2 to coexist with a native networking service.

   RTPS_AGGRESSIVE_KEEP_LAST1_WHC causes a reliable writer to drop a
   sample from its WHC as soon as a new sample for the same instance
   is accepted for transmission, no longer keeping the old one
   available for retransmission.

   RTPS_CONSERVATIVE_BUILTIN_READER_STARTUP causes all SEDP and PMD
   readers to try to get all data, even though all-but-one have no
   need for it.

   RTPS_NOQUEUE_HEARTBEAT_MESSAGES causes heartbeats to be transmitted
   immediately upon generation of the heartbeat messages, instead of
   queuing them so they end up behind data queued for immediate
   transmission (i.e., enables old behaviour). At high data rates,
   this behaviour results in heartbeats advertising sequence numbers
   of messages still lingering in the transmit queue, and likely cause
   NAKs. */

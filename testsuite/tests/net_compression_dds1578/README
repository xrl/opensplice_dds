This test is for compression of OpenSplice network packets (enhancement
dds1578). It consists of a publisher which sends a series of strings to a
subscriber. Each sample includes a simple checksum so that data integrity
may be verified, and we use the network service statistics to check that
compression is taking place.

Some sample text from Project Gutenberg is included.


Configuration
-------------

In the Opensplice configuration file, network statistics must be enabled.

<OpenSplice>
   <Domain>
...
      <Statistics>
         <Category enabled="true" name="networking"/>
      </Statistics>

also compression must be enabled for the topic used in the test.

<OpenSplice>
...
   <NetworkService name="networking">
      <Partitioning>
         <GlobalPartition Address="broadcast"/>
         <NetworkPartitions>
            <NetworkPartition Address="broadcast" Compression="true" Connected="true" Name="defpart"/>
         </NetworkPartitions>
         <PartitionMappings>
            <PartitionMapping DCPSPartitionTopic="net1578.*" NetworkPartition="defpart"/>
         </PartitionMappings>
      </Partitioning>

Running the test
----------------

Start OpenSplice on two nodes.

On one node, run the publisher with a text file on standard input, eg
./ccpp_net_compression_dds1578_pub -ORBInitRef ccpp_net_compression_dds1578_sub=corbaloc:iiop:node2:56789/ccpp_net_compression_dds1578_sub -ORBEndpoint iiop://:67890 < data/sample.txt

On the other, start the subscriber :
./ccpp_net_compression_dds1578_sub -ORBInitRef ccpp_net_compression_dds1578_pub=corbaloc:iiop:node1:67890/ccpp_net_compression_dds1578_pub -ORBEndpoint iiop://:56789


Expected results
----------------

Both process should terminate normally.
Sample publisher output :

Sent all text
Sent 30674 bytes; compressed from 46220 bytes
Shutdown ...

Sample subscriber output :

Received 30674 bytes; decompressed to 46220 bytes

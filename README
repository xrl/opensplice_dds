OpenSplice libdds

Building for yourself

1. run "libtoolize -c" or "glibtoolize -c"
2. autoreconf -fv --install

Notes

Now it looks like I'll have to wrestle with the platform specific files. This one file in particular shows some strong platform dependence.

  src/abstraction/pa/sparc/code/pa_abstract.c

Will also copy how Suricata auto-discovers the current platform and let me sub in PLATFORM and ARCH. I want to support a range of platforms so let's look at this table for now

  PLATFORM  |  ARCH
  -----------------
  Linux2.6  | x86
  Linux2.6  | x86_64

I will leave the original code for sparc and solaris but since I do not have any of these platforms I will be leaving them as a TODO.
